# 42MiniRT

This project is an introduction to Raytracing: a simulation of light and its interactions with physical objects with the help of mathematical formulas and the MLX42 graphics library.

/**
 * @var oc: vector from the ray origin to a point on the plane
 * @var numerator: numerator of the function to calculate t
 * @var denominator: denominator of the function to calculate t
 * if the denominator is close to 0, the ray will be parallel to the plane, so
 * they either perfectly coincide, offering an infinite number of solutions,
 * or they do not intersect at all. If t is negative, the intersection happens
 * nbehind the ray origin, which we don't want to take into consideration.
 * If the ray is coming from the back side of the plane, we want to invert the normal.
 * @return value: t_intersection struct if there is an intersection, NULL if there is not
 * or if the intersection happens behind the camera.

/**
 * the larger Î¸ becomes, the less of an impact
 * the light should have on the fragment's color.
 * to get (only) the cosine of the angle between
 * both vectors we will work with unit vectors (vectors of length 1)
 * so we need to make sure all the vectors are normalized
 * surface_normal: a vector that is perpendicular to the vertex' surface.
 * The directed light ray: a direction vector that is the difference vector
 * between the light's position and the fragment's position. To calculate this light
 * ray we need the light's position vector and the fragment's position vector.
 * @param l: a linked list of light sources
 * @param hit_rec: a t_intersection struct that contains the surface normal and the point where the object was hit
